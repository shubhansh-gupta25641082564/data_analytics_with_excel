# Important Notice: Install MS Excel

Excel will cost you less than **INR 100 for a lifetime license**. Yes, you will need to install MS Excel.

**No**, we won't use Google Sheets.

**And HELL NO**, we won't use "Numbers" for those of you with MacBooks. ;)

If you don't have it installed already, please buy Office 365. It will cost you **INR 299 to 599 for a 5-person license**, effectively bringing the cost down to less than **INR 100 per person**.

Of course, the decision to buy and where to buy it from is yours, but we can only recommend from our experience.

So please make sure that you have it installed before we start.
